# Credit-Card_fraud-Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It leverages a real-world dataset and trains a **Random Forest classifier** to accurately classify transactions as fraud or legitimate.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Preprocessing and encoding of categorical data  
- Balanced dataset handling  
- Model training using Random Forest  
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anushkaaa1618/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
